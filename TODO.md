## 📝 Development Notes

### Authentication System Implementation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Security**: Password hashing with bcrypt
- **Structure**: Modular design with config/, models/, schemas/ folders

### E-Commerce System Implementation
- **Product Management**: Comprehensive product model with support for both new and second-hand items
- **Database Design**: Proper enum handling, relationship management, and data validation
- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic V2 with field validators and model validators
- **Business Logic**: Service layer pattern for clean separation of concerns

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (async) with proper enum handling
- **AI**: Groq API for LLM interactions
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + AWS

### Recent Technical Achievements
- **Database Enum Alignment**: Fixed mismatch between database enum values and application schemas
- **SQLAlchemy Optimization**: Cleaned up relationship configurations and removed unused models
