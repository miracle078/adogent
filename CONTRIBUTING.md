    <br> 
</p>

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.11+** installed
- **Docker & Docker Compose** installed
- **Git** configured with your credentials
- **Groq API Key** for testing AI features

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thegoldenage.git
   cd thegoldenage
   ```

## üåø Branch Management

### Create a New Branch

Before starting work, create a new branch off the main branch. Use the following naming convention:

- For features: `feat/descriptive-name`
- For fixes: `fix/descriptive-name`
- For chores: `chore/descriptive-name`

**Example:** To create a new branch for a feature called "add user authentication":

```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-user-authentication
```

This will create a new branch and switch to it.

### Branch Guidelines

- Keep branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Use descriptive names that explain the purpose
- Regularly sync with main branch to avoid conflicts
- Delete branches after successful merge

## üíª Development Workflow

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start development services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Make Your Changes

Work on your changes, whether it's:
- Updating documentation
- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs
- Performing maintenance tasks

### Code Standards

- **Follow PEP 8** style guidelines
- **Use type hints** for all functions
- **Write comprehensive docstrings** for classes and functions
- **Maintain test coverage** above 85%
- **Use async/await** for all database operations
- **Follow the service layer pattern** - keep business logic in services, not routers

### Testing

Before submitting your changes:

1. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest
   ```

2. **Check code quality:**
   ```bash
   black app/
   ruff check app/
   mypy app/
   ```

3. **Test API endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Start the server
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   
   # Access API docs
   open http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use the following format for your commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user authentication"
```

The commit message format follows conventional commits:

```
type(scope): short description

Longer description of the changes, if necessary.
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (updating dependencies, etc.)

- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `ci`: Changes to CI/CD pipeline

### Commit Scope

The scope indicates the area of the codebase affected:
- `auth`: Authentication and authorization
- `api`: API endpoints and routing
- `agents`: AI agent implementations
- `db`: Database models and migrations
- `services`: Business logic services
- `tests`: Test files
- `docs`: Documentation
- `config`: Configuration files

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat(agents): add product recommendation agent"
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve JWT token validation issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
git commit -m "test(api): add integration tests for order endpoints"
```
